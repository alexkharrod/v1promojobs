# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Layer Architecture
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
   - Django templates with HTML5/CSS3
   - JavaScript with React/Vue.js integration
   - Responsive design implementation

2. Application Layer (Backend)
   - Django REST framework
   - Business logic implementation
   - Service layer abstraction

3. Data Layer
   - SQLite database
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - Data access abstraction

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
- Implemented for all database operations
- Centralized data access logic
- Consistent error handling
- Transaction management

### Service Layer Pattern
- Business logic encapsulation
- Cross-cutting concerns handling
- Service-to-service communication

### Factory Pattern
- User type creation (Employer/Job Seeker)
- Form generation
- Search query building

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- Users (Base entity)
- JobSeekers (Profile extension)
- Employers (Company profile)
- Jobs (Listings)
- Applications (Job applications)
- Reviews (Optional company reviews)

### Relationships
- One-to-One: User to Profile
- One-to-Many: Employer to Jobs
- Many-to-Many: Jobs to JobSeekers (through Applications)

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Session-based authentication
- Token-based API authentication
- Two-factor authentication support

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Permission-based actions
- Resource ownership validation

## Error Handling

### Logging Strategy
- Application-level logging
- Error tracking and monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

### Error Response Pattern
- Consistent error format
- HTTP status code mapping
- Error categorization

## Caching Strategy
- View-level caching
- Query result caching
- Static asset caching

## File Storage
- Media files (resumes, company logos)
- Temporary file handling
- Cloud storage integration ready

## Testing Architecture
- Unit testing framework
- Integration test suite
- End-to-end testing capability
- Test data factories

## Deployment Pattern
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker container support
- CI/CD pipeline ready
